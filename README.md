## Labs

There are a few labs you need to go through to complete the workshop. They are:

- **[PRESENTER ONLY - Configure Shared Resources and ATC App](./flysimexpress-presenter.md)**

  - If you are attending the workshop, your presenter will go through this for the entire group.  You can just sit back and enjoy the ride.

  - If you will be completing the entire workshop yourself, you will need to complete this first lab yourself. You will also need a Windows 10 Professional or better workstation and Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition or better to run the Air Traffic Control Simulator (AirTrafficSim) UWP application as described in the prerequistes above.
